To build this demo run

ant compile

To run the tests do the following:

1. First ensure that your FINEFIT_HOME environment variable points to the
location of FineFit's specification library files, e.g.

export FINEFIT_HOME="C:\cygwin64\home\davidf\src\finefit\src"

(replace the initial part of the path by the location of the finefit intallation)

2. Then run the following from the command line

$ ant -emacs test

(the -emacs flag disables prefixing each line in the output with the [test] label)
